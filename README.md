# Command Line Interface Tool

## About
- A command line tool that can automates commands through javascript in the command line, and allows for manipulation of files
- The purpose of this command line tool is to automate things in the command line that are monotonous. I intend to use this for school, starting the fall of 2017.
- Uses NodeJS and Node Package Manager
- Known command lines that work: Iterm2, Git Bash, Cmder. (some commands that cli uses can break depending on the Operatiing System, such as "grep")
- This command line tool is based off what I learned from my time as an intern at IGT
- I can be reached at brandonchan@utexas.edu

## Installation

1. Navigate to the cli directory in command line.
2. Run "npm install" and "npm link" (must have NodeJS and node package manager).
3. Cli should be ready for use. Through "npm link," the command "cli" will be global.

## Instructions

### Getting it to work

- Run through the installation instructions above.
- In order to run the functionality of cli, type "cli" in the command line. This will bring up a menu of operations you can perform.
- Bringing up the menu results in user prompting for a menu option. Choose a menu operation to perform.
- Additionally, if a user already knows the operation choice in advance, enter "cli <operation>" in the command line, and that operation will be executed immediately.
